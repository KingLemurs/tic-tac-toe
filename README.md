My design process for this assignment was to override as many of the functions provided by the framework. 
All of my changes were in the TicTacToe class, and most of the functions had very similar code. In the future,
I'll probably refactor the excessive for loops into something I can share among the winner/draw check functions.

For this assignment I worked on a mac again.

EDIT: When creating a github repo it made a new folder which made Cmake fail builds so I had to change the directory name, thats all
